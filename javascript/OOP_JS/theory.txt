### oop javascript ###

# in js we can define an defined onject without define a class
# a class follows 4 principales of oop:

1) abstraction:
    abstraction consists in simplify the creation and usability of a class hiding some attributes and methods
    also, abstraction allows you to do complex things with the minimum amount of steps

2) inheritence:
    it's used to avoid reduntant code
    we define an astract class with generic properies that many subclass can share and build other classes or objects with similar properies between them

3) encapulation:
    we use attributes with related methods to simplify the process of creating and using objects

4) polymorphism
    consists of making generic classes with generic behaviuors that will be defied in the specific classes that extend the primal abstract class

### typescript ###
typescript allowa you to go deeper in oop with protected attributes and methods, interfaces and types
