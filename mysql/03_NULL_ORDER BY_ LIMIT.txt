/* Other operators */

// NULL (missing values)
TO find a missing op we use IS NULL

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE address IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE address IS NOT NULL;

// ORDER BY (sorting)
By default a query is sorted by id
we can change it with ORDER BY value (in numerical order if in and alfabetical order if varchar)
we can also use ASC DESC

// LIMIT (limits the number of records we receive as an output)
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3 // first 3 results
