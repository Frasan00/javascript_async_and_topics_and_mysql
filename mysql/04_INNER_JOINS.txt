/* INNER JOIN */

// used to select columns from more than one table
we use JOIN for a inner join, the we type ON and the condition (usually on the key like ids)

es inner join
SELECT * 
FROM orders
JOIN customers
	ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id

/* LEFT JOIN */
you can use LEFT JOIN in case you want to add elements from the first table and, in case there is a missmatch
the elements of the second table will be set to NULL

ES.
SELECT firstName, lastName, city, state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
    ON p.personId  = a.personId
